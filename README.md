As part of a retrospective event on the 10-year anniversary of the financial crisis, the Economic Studies program at Brookings produced a number of research looking into the causes of the crisis. 

I created an interactive map using D3.js and Angular to accompany one such piece. The map shows where the share of nonbank mortgages are greatest in the U.S. 

On hover over a county, a tool tip displays both the percentage of all mortgages as well as the county name.
